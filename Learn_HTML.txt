HTML- Hypertext markup language
      standard markup language for creating Web pages
      describes the structure of a Web page


    eg:

        <!DOCTYPE html> <!--defines that this document is an HTML5 document -->
        <html> <!-- root element of an HTML page -->
        <head> <!-- contains meta information about the HTML page -->
        <title>Page Title</title> <!-- specifies a title for the HTML page -->
        </head>
        <body> <!-- defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. -->
        <h1>My First Heading</h1> <!-- defines a large heading -->
        <p>My first paragraph.</p> <!-- defines a paragraph -->
        </body>
        </html>

* Save file as filename.html or filename.htm



HTML Headings
    HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
    <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
    
    eg:
        
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
   
        
        
HTML Paragraphs
    HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.
    eg:
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>



HTML Links
    HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
    eg:
        <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
       

HTML Images
    HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.
    eg:
        <img src="google.jpg" alt="google.com" width="104" height="142">
        
        
HTML Elements
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
    eg:
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    
    HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
    Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag.
    HTML is Not Case Sensitive
    

    
Empty HTML Elements
    HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
    The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.
    eg:
        <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>


HTML Attributes
    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
        
        
The href Attribute
    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
    eg:
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

        
The src Attribute
    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
    The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
    eg:
        <img src="google.jpg">
        
        
The width and height Attributes
    The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes,
    which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels).
    eg:
        <img src="google.jpg" width="500" height="600">


        
The alt Attribute
    The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image,
    if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection,
    or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
    eg:
        <img src="google.jpg" alt="google.com">
        
        

The style Attribute
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
    eg:
        <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

        
        
HTML Horizontal Rules
    The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, 
    and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
    eg:
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
        <hr>
        
        
HTML Line Breaks
    The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
    Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
    eg:
        <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
