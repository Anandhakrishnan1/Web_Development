HTML- Hypertext markup language
      standard markup language for creating Web pages
      describes the structure of a Web page


    eg:

        <!DOCTYPE html> <!--defines that this document is an HTML5 document -->
        <html> <!-- root element of an HTML page -->
        <head> <!-- contains meta information about the HTML page -->
        <title>Page Title</title> <!-- specifies a title for the HTML page -->
        </head>
        <body> <!-- defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. -->
        <h1>My First Heading</h1> <!-- defines a large heading -->
        <p>My first paragraph.</p> <!-- defines a paragraph -->
        </body>
        </html>

* Save file as filename.html or filename.htm



HTML Headings
    HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
    <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
    
    eg:
        
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
   
        
        
HTML Paragraphs
    HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.
    eg:
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>



HTML Links
    HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
    eg:
        <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
       

HTML Images
    HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.
    eg:
        <img src="google.jpg" alt="google.com" width="104" height="142">
        
        
HTML Elements
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
    eg:
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    
    HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
    Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag.
    HTML is Not Case Sensitive
    

    
Empty HTML Elements
    HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
    The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.
    eg:
        <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
